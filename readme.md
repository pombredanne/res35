Zarino and Tom went to these CRM sites and bootstrapped an adjacency list of their
connector apps in their marketplaces. We visited the marketplaces of any other
SaaS things that were connected in this network.


The `from` and `to` indicate where we found the integrator tools, not
the direction of the integration; some of these tools go in both directions.

We started with these CRMs.

* Highrise
* Nimble
* Capsule

We ignored Salesforce because its marketplace was too big and we
couldn't easily tell what the connections were.

All three of these first three CRM connect to MailChimp and Wufoo.
